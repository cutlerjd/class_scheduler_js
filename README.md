# Class scheduler in JavaScript

My current job I work on an internal application that handles tons of the training for the company, among many other things. It's written in Java, utilizes Struts as a framework, and has the touches of many, many programmers before me. I often wonder what it would be like if the program was architected differently from the start.

I've also been reading a fair amount of Martin Fowler, both on Refactoring and on Enterprise Application Design, so I decided to do a bit of a "what-if" with this repo. This would never replace my works application, nor does it utilize their business rules or processes. It's just a user story of "how do you schedule and handle classes with multiple campuses?" While trying to design it in a way that makes sense to me.
